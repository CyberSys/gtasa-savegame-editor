# GTA SA savegame editor

This is a modified version of the software that can be found on [paulinternet.nl](http://paulinternet.nl/?page=sa).

This version contains mostly macOS specific fixes and requires Java > 8. That said, if you try to run it on windows it may crash or missing some features.

## Building

To build the application:

```bash
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

You should now have a `.jar` file in the `target` folder. Run it.
